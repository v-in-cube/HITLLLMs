Here is the retrosynthetic path you need to analyze in JSON format:"""

suffix = """# EVALUATION CRITERIA

For each individual reaction step, assess:
1. Chemical feasibility and likelihood of success
2. Appropriateness of disconnection strategy
3. Selectivity considerations (regio-, stereo-, chemo-)
4. Functional group compatibility
5. Protecting group strategy
6. Step necessity and efficiency
7. Reagent selection and optimization
8. Potential side reactions or competing pathways

For the overall synthetic route, evaluate:
1. Overall feasibility of the complete pathway
2. Step economy and efficiency
3. Convergence of the approach
4. Use of commercially available or easily accessible starting materials
5. Scalability potential
6. Purification and isolation considerations

# REACTION FEEDBACK CATEGORIES
For each reaction step, select the MOST APPROPRIATE category, maximum 2:
- "Reaction feasible, all good" - The proposed transformation is well-established and likely to proceed as expected and written
- "Reaction feasible, unexpected disconnection" - The reaction would work but represents non-typical bond disconnection which is inventive and effective, but potentially less precedent
- "Unlikely disconnection" - The proposed transformation is chemically impossible
- "Selectivity (regio-, stereo-, chemo-) issues" - The reaction would face significant regio-, stereo-, or chemoselectivity challenges
- "Functional group compatibility problems" - Incompatible functional groups are present in the reactant molecule that would interfere with the desired transformation
- "Protecting group strategy is wrong/non-optimal" - The protecting group selection is flawed, unnecessary, or inefficient, REQUIRES you to access the reaction in the context of the whole route
- "Unnecessary step" - The transformation adds complexity to the synthesis or may not work at all, but is unnecessary as its product is commercially available, REQUIRES you to access the reaction in the context of the whole route
- "Non-optimal reagent" - The exact reactant may not work in this reaction, but close analogues exist for this transformation with the same bond disconnection

# ROUTE FEEDBACK CATEGORIES
For the overall route, select the MOST APPROPRIATE category:
- "Route feasible as it is" - The synthetic route is well-designed and should work as proposed
- "Route feasible with few modifications" - The route is generally sound but would benefit from minor adjustments
- "Route feasible with significant modifications" - The core strategy has merit but requires substantial changes
- "Route unfeasible" - The proposed route contains major problems that make the whole disconnection strategy not feasible
- "Route was not solved to building blocks" - The retrosynthesis is incomplete and doesn't reach commercially available starting materials

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
1. Provide a detailed, chemically accurate assessment for each reaction step
2. For problematic steps, suggest specific improvements where possible
3. Assess commercial availability of starting materials
4. Identify potential competing reactions or yield-limiting factors
5. Assign a confidence score (0-100) for each evaluation
6. Structure your feedback in the exact JSON format specified below

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Your response must be a valid JSON with the following structure:
{
  "feedback": {
    "hash_of_the_reaction": {
      "feedback": "chosen category from reaction feedback options",
      "feedback_text": "detailed chemical explanation of your assessment, including specific issues and suggestions",
      "confidence": confidence_score_0_to_100
    },
    // Additional reactions...
  },
  "general_feedback": {
    "hash_of_the_root_molecule": {
      "feedback": "chosen category from route feedback options",
      "feedback_text": "comprehensive analysis of the overall synthetic strategy, highlighting strengths and weaknesses",
      "confidence": confidence_score_0_to_100
    }
  }
}
both hash_of_the_reaction and hash_of_the_root_molecule are represented in AiZynthfinder as "hash" and by type of the node you need to recognize which is which.
 Prioritize chemical accuracy over comprehensiveness. If you are uncertain about a particular transformation, indicate this in your feedback and assign an appropriate confidence score. Base your evaluation on established chemical principles and literature precedent. 
# INPUT FORMAT 
The input will be provided as a JSON structure from AiZynthfinder representing a retrosynthetic tree with nested reactions.
